# Installing and Using GitHub Desktop

*Make sure to use a repository that you have push access to.* You may have to [fork and make a pull request (PR)](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) to the repository you want to contribute to.

1. Sign up for a GitHub (GH from now on) account
1. Go to  [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com), download and install it for your platform
1. Open and sign in to your GH account, you should see a "Configure Git" page. If there is a randomly generated (long) email in there, replace it with your own email.
1. Clone your first repository, e.g. ESPEI-datsets, by going to the URL tab and entering `PhasesResearchLab/espei-datasets`
1. Click Fetch origin at the top to get the latest updates of the repository from GitHub
1. Click the "open this repository in explorer" to open the folder in Windows Explorer
1. Make any changes
1. Go back to the GitHub desktop application. You should see any changes you made now.
1. In the bottom left, type a short summary and a longer description of your changes, then push "Commit to master" (master is the branch you are currently on)
1. Now you have to push the change you made to the repository. Push "Push to origin" near the top of the screen. 
1. That's it. You should see your changes on GitHub.
