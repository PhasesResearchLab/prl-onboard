===============================================

Objectives
==========

* Use the GitHub issue tracker
* Practice test driven development
* Update documentation
* Submit a pull request and get reviewed


Tasks
=====

1. Go to the `pycalphad issue tracker`_ and find an interesting open issue marked with the ``beginner`` label.
2. Familiarize yourself with the bug. Write a failing test that should pass if the issue was fixed. If you think the issue you are working on is not suitable for a test, comment in the issue with why the fix cannot be tested and offer an alternative solution. @mention your mentor for a second opinion. 
3. Fix the issue using the skills you have developed so far.
4. Update any relevant documentation. Consider those that might come after you. Leave the codebase better than you found it.
5. Create a pull request. Use GitHub to assign your mentor as the reviewer.
6. Close the issue after the pull request is merged.
