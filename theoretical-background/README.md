# Theoretical Background

The Python course is a practical introduction to the tools and methods in the Phases Research Lab.
These readings and problems will guide you through the technical background required for success.

Since this course is a sister course to the Python course, some of the readings intentionally overlap.

Aside from the background section, each section should be more or less self-contained.
You are intended to proceed through each section in order, reading the chapter and completing the problems at the end.
The problems are specifically selected for things that will be useful to know, so it is in your best interest to complete them.

The selected readings were chosen because they were thought to offer the clearest explanation of the key topic.
One book cannot be all to all readers, so alternate resources are listed at the end of each section.
