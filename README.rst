PRL Onboard
===========

This repository is designed to 

1. Provide you with the Phases Resarch Lab handbook (in progress), which will be your guide to PRL and Penn State
2. Give you the learning resources to get started with Python, pycalphad (CALPHAD), and atomate (DFT)


Reading
=======

What we do
----------

Before you join PRL and/or to get an idea of our work, please read the following articles:

* Liu, Z. K. First-Principles Calculations and CALPHAD Modeling of Thermodynamics. Calphad 30, 517â€“534 (2009). `10.1007/s11669-009-9570-6`_

Learning computational thermodynamics
-------------------------------------

To get started with learning the theoretical and practical skills for success, the following resoures are suggested:

All of these resources are either free or we have physical copies that you can borrow in the lab.

Course
======

The PRL onboarding course is designed to introduce you to computational thermodynamics from a minimal materials science background.

The course is designed to be completed entirely by self-study. You are encouraged to do exercises in the books along the way and to complete including assignments that will walk you through the first steps of collaborative computational thermodynamics research.

Visit the ``course`` directory for the recommend onboarding course. It is still a work in progress.
